      Hi! I am Aarathi Kumaran. I have always been into creative hobbies—photography and painting were some of my first loves as a kid. A couple of years ago, I picked up crochet and instantly got hooked (pun intended). I have especially loved making little toys, and I have got a few fun projects in progress that I will be adding soon 😉.

      Pottery is something I want to keep doing in the future. I took a class at the University of Michigan and absolutely loved it. Miniatures are another favorite—I get these tiny sets from Hobby Lobby, and I am obsessed with how detailed and functional everything is. It is my dream to build a full miniature house one day.

      This site is just a space for me to share some of my favorite pieces so far. Hope you enjoy looking through it!
